# **Battleships 1977**
## **Overview**


Battleships 1977 is a python-based version of the classic Battleships board game. In this particular iteration of the game, the user plays against the computer in a turn-based competition where the objective is to eliminate all of the opponent's ships before their own are destroyed.

There are four ships ranging from one tile in length up to a length of four tiles. When either the user or cpu hits and destroys all of the opposing ships, the game is over.

This edition of the game has been loosely based on the popular sci-fi series 'Star Wars' The original movie was released in 1977, hence the appendage to the title of the game.

It features space-based ASCII art, and contains various references to characters, vessels and ideologies from the movie. The intention was to provide a fresh and different setting to the classic game which is situated in an ocean and played with contemporary seafaring vessels such as aircraft carriers and frigate etc.

The user is guided through some Star Wars-related imagery and text before being prompted to enter their name. The rules and legend are presented before the game requests the user place their ships on the board. There is the option to place the ships horizontally or vertically, and then the use must decide on x and y coordinates to assign the relevant ship.

The CPU ships are assigned random coordinates. The game is designed so that the user goes first. Upon completion of the game, the user is presented with a screen informing them that they have either won or lost. Then they are asked if they wish to play again or quit.

## **Planning Stage**

<br>

#### **Target Audiences:**
* People who like the classic Battleships‚Äã game.
* People who are looking for a science-fiction-based take on the classic game.
* People looking for an online version of the game.
* People who are fans of Star Wars.
* Aspiring coders looking for a simple but effective code.

‚Äã
#### **User Stories:**
* As a user, I want to understand the premise of the game.
* As a user, I want to quickly learn and understand the rules of the game and its instructions.
* As a user, I want a clean and simple user interface (UI).
* As a user, I want the game to run smoothly and bug-free.
* As a user, I want to be able to choose whether or not to play again when the game ends.
* As a user, I want to be able to win against the computer.

‚Äã
#### **Site Aims:**
* To offer the user a smooth and bug free version of a classic game with a slightly different twist.
* To provide a clean and simple interface for the user with no need to reference external sources.
* To provide clear instructions and a win condition.
* To provide an enjoyable user experience of playing battleships.
* To provide an interesting and entertaining Star Wars-based version of the game.


#### **Lucid Chart:**

To help with the planning stages‚Äã‚Äã of this project, I used [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com)
This proved to be very useful tool when it came to visualising the various processes involved in recreating a Battleships style game. Whilst the concept is quite simple, the logic involved proved slightly more difficult.

This is the flow chart which assisted the development of the game:

<br>‚Äã

#### **Colour Scheme:**
‚Äã

* Not in the scope of this project, however I used cyan text for the start screen to evoke a connection with the Star Wars theme. I then used yellow for the subsequent text for the same reason.

## **Features**
‚Äã
#### **Start Screen** 

![Screenshot of start screen](assets/images/bs77-start-screen.png)

* The splash screen features a gradient background featuring the colours outlined above.
* There is an h1 heading featuring the title of the game.
* The music and SFX button is below the heading. By default, the music and SFX do not play. The button will toggle both.
* The synopsis is in a bordered div and gives a brief story for the user in order to engage them in the game.
* Beneath the synopsis is a countdown timer which counts from 20 seconds to zero, giving the user time to read the synopsis and/or toggle the music.
* FInally, there is a skip button which gives the user the option of skipping the splash screen entirely, either when they are ready or if they have visited the site on multiple occasions.
* All text is white (#FFF) to offer a contrast to the background and the borders are slightly softer (#DADBD0) to offer a softer contrast.

#### **Game Start Screen** 
![Screenshot of start game and leaderboard screen](assets/images/hypercube-game-screenshot.png)

* Once the splash screen has counted down or been skipped, the game screen presents the user with the game canvas which is partially covered with the overlay card. The card features a start button which starts the game.
* There is also a toggle music button which works in the same manner as the one on the splash screen. As there will be too little time to adjust these effects during gameplay, it makes most sense to have the button situated here.
* The card also features the leaderboard which utilises local storage to save the top 5 high scores. The scores will remain in the browser on refresh and restart.
* The clear button will remove all saved high scores from local storage ready for the table to be populated anew.
* The background for this screen is a CSS animation which features small stars drifting slowly upwards. It was important to choose a background that wasn't too demanding in terms of processing power as well as one that minimised distraction during gameplay. However, I feel it contributes well to the overall atmosphere and immersion in the game. 

#### **The Game Itself** 

![Screenshot of game](assets/images/hypercube-gameplay.png)

* Upon start, the player character (the white square) appears to move towards the black 'monoliths'. In terms of the game logic, it is actually only the monoliths that move.
* The player character jumps through a press of the spacebar or a screen tap on mobile devices. Upon jumping the player character executes a perfect 360 degree jump.
* For every 10 blocks that are successfully jumped, the speed of the black monoliths increases.
* The player scores a point for every obsatcle that is successfully cleared.
* As it is an endless jumper, the goal is to score highest on the leaderboard. 
* If the player achieves a top 5 high score they are prompted to enter their name in the leaderboard. Alternatively, they can click cancel which logs 'Anonymous' to the leaderboard.

‚Äã
## **Future-Enhancements**
‚Äã
There are a several areas with scope for future improvement. This project has been very challenging and ultimately the project deadline was looming. I would have liked to add the following:
‚Äã
* Adding a player vs player option.
* The option of skipping the rules and legend for returning players.
* The option to randomly place player ships for quicker games.
* An option to have small, medium or large boards with corresponding ship sizes.

‚Äã
## **Testing Phase**
‚Äã
**Functionality**

* The game was played from start to finish multiple times.
* To ensure validation was functioning as expected, invalid coordinates and inputs were entered which returned the expected results. 
* It is not possible to begin the game without correctly positioning all ships.
* The game ends as expected when the conditions for a win are satisfied.
* The game will run until the conditions are satisfied.
* The function to play a new game or quit functions as expected. 
* The leaderboard functions as intended on desktop and mobile. 
* The game was tested in a local terminal and on the live deployment on Heroku.

‚Äã
**Validators**

* The PEP8 Online Validator was down when creating this project, however I added a PEP8 validator to my workspace by running the command: "pip3 install pycodestyle". The results can be found [here](assets/images/bs1977-pycodestyle.png)

* The validator flags a number of warnings, all of which are related to the use of the ASCII art used in the start screen, win screen and lose screen functions.

‚Äã
‚Äã
## **Bugs**
‚Äã
The following bugs were identified during user testing:

* üêû - At first it was not possible to get the music to play on any device.
* ‚öíÔ∏è - The file was unplayable when situated in my assets or audio folder.
* ‚úÖ - I added the audio file to the root directory and it worked.

<br>

* üêû - The SFX ran by default on all devices which could be undesirable for many users.
* ‚öíÔ∏è - The corresponding JS function specified volume on page load.
* ‚úÖ - Set the volume to zero until the user clicks or taps the toggle music and SFX button

‚Äã<br>

* üêû - The game music had a hissing sound which affected the user experience.
* ‚öíÔ∏è - I used a .wav file which had become distorted after compression.
* ‚úÖ - Converted to an .mp3 file which was smaller than the compressed .wav file but sounds fine.

<br>

* üêû - The original SCSS background worked well on a MacBook Pro but caused huge lag and unplayable game quality on some devices.
* ‚öíÔ∏è - The SCSS was too CPU intensive on some devices.
* ‚úÖ - I used a different background animation which was more subtle but works on all devices in testing.

<br>

* üêû - The game was initially too hard.
* ‚öíÔ∏è - The speed of each block was too fast.
* ‚úÖ - Slowed the starting speed of the blocks and set them to move incrementally faster.

<br>

* üêû - The skip button on the splash screen would be hidden by the browser bar on smaller mobile devices. This meant users who had played the game multiple occasiosn would have to wait for the countdown to finish.
* ‚öíÔ∏è - Whilst the page is responsive it dodn't take into account the browser bar.
* ‚úÖ - Adjusted the CSS grid spacing to take into account screen sizes of 415px and smaller which accounts for mobile devices.

<br>

* üêû - The score SFX would not play on loading of the page which was as intended, however upon toggling sound on and off it would continue to play even when the music and jump SFX would be muted.
* ‚öíÔ∏è - The score SFX had been tied to intricately to the game itself.
* ‚úÖ - I had been uncertain about the score SFX and although it worked well on desktop, there was sometimes a lag on certain mobile devices so I removed it altogether.

<br>

## **Unfixed Bugs**

* There are no known unfixed bugs.

## **Deployment**

## ***Final Deployment to Heroku:***  
  
The project was deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) using the below procedure:-    
  
1. **Log in to Heroku** or create an account if required.
1. **click** the button labeled **New** from the dashboard in the top right corner, just below the header.
1. From the drop-down menu **select "Create new app"**.
1. **Enter a unique app name**. I combined my GitHub user name and the game's name with a dash between them (dnlbowers-battleship) for this project.
1. Once the web portal shows the green tick to confirm the name is original **select the relevant region.** In my case, I chose Europe as I am in the UK.
1.  When happy with your choice of name and that the correct region is selected, **click** on the **"Create app" button**.
1. This will bring you to the project "Deploy" tab. From here, navigate to the **settings tab** and scroll down to the **"Config Vars" section**.

## **Tech**
‚Äã
I used the following technologies for the Battleships 1977 project:
‚Äã
- Python

## **Libraries**

The following libraries were used:

* Random - Used to generate random numbers for CPU ship placement, CPU guessing and CPU attacks.
* OS - Used to clear the terminal so the user would not get overwhelmed with information.
* RE - Used to check for valid column input.
* Time - Used for pauses in flow of information and to simulate CPU decision making.

## **Software**

The following software was used:

- Gitpod and VS Code to create, load and push my code to Github.
- Git (Gitpod and Github) as my version control for the site.
